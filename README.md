# 75DaysHardWorkChallenge

Welcome to the 75 Days Hard Work Challenge! This challenge is designed to help you improve your problem-solving skills, expand your knowledge in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AIML), enhance your full stack development skills, and prioritize your physical and mental well-being. By participating in this challenge, you'll embark on a journey of continuous learning and personal growth.

## Challenge Tasks

1. **Problem of the Day (POTD)**:
   - Solve a daily problem from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. This will enhance your problem-solving skills and expose you to a variety of algorithmic challenges.

2. **AIML Learning**:
   - Dedicate time each day to learning from an AIML course. Whether it's understanding new algorithms, exploring machine learning models, or diving into deep learning concepts, consistent learning will help you stay updated in this rapidly evolving field.

3. **Full Stack Learning**:
   - Engage in daily learning sessions focused on full stack development. From frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to backend frameworks like Node.js or Django, expand your skills across the entire development stack.

4. **DSA Problem Solving**:
   - Solve a minimum of 5 daily problems related to data structures and algorithms (DSA). Additionally, practice at least 5 dynamic programming (DP) problems regularly to reinforce your understanding of this crucial concept.

5. **Participation in Coding Contests**:
   - Participate daily in Codeforces and LeetCode contests. Engaging in competitive programming contests will sharpen your problem-solving abilities and expose you to a competitive coding environment.

6. **Health and Fitness**:
   - Prioritize your physical health by incorporating gym sessions and fitness activities into your daily routine. Staying active and healthy is essential for maintaining productivity and overall well-being.

7. **Soft Skills Development**:
   - Work on enhancing your soft skills by dedicating time to profile preparation daily. This includes improving your resume, practicing for interviews, and honing communication and interpersonal skills.
